The easiest way that i have found to do this is to create a juction to my "Documents folder" like so:
* junction "XXXSOME PATH TO YOUR USERNAME FOLDER XXX\Documents" localdocuments

Then create one which is either to vs 2012 or 2010 depending on what you are working with
* junction "localdocuments\Visual Studio 2010\Addins" localaddin
or
* junction "localdocuments\Visual Studio 2010\Addins" localaddin


Change the start properties to start a version of visual studio (2010 or 2012) and send this command line arg
* C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe
or
* C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe

You need to change the path to the correct path for you

* /resetaddin Vukos.VisualStudio.ConfigurationManager.ConfigurationPlugin

Set the working path to the visual studio path
